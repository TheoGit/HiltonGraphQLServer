# HiltonGraphQLServer

This is the server for the Hilton Reservations App
It uses the Apollo Server to create a GraphQL server

The node_modules were not added, running "npm install" should load all dependencies

Running "node src/index.js" from the command line will start his server.

Opening a web page and typing "http://localhost:4000/graphql" will allow you to test this code

It's also ready to be used by the App
